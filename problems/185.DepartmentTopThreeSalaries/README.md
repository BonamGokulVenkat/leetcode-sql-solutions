# 185. Department Top Three Salaries

## Problem Statement
We are given two tables:

### Employee
- `id` (int): Employee ID
- `name` (varchar): Employee name
- `salary` (int): Employee salary
- `departmentId` (int): Foreign key referencing Department.id

### Department
- `id` (int): Department ID
- `name` (varchar): Department name

A **high earner** in a department is defined as an employee whose salary is within the **top 3 unique salaries** of that department.

We need to return each high earner along with their department name and salary.

**Employee**
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |

**Department**
| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | IT    |

### Output
| Department | Employee | Salary |
|------------|----------|--------|
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |

## Approach
1. Use a window function (`DENSE_RANK`) partitioned by department, ordered by salary descending.  
2. Select employees with rank â‰¤ 3.  
3. Join with `Department` to get department names.
